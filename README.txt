===================
=: Core Concepts :=
===================

- List the four core concepts, the features they implement, and why each feature
  is an appropriate use of the concept. Incorporate the feedback you got after
  submitting your proposal.

  1. I/O Input and output - Read AND Write 

  2. Testable Component
  

  3. Inheritance/Subtyping
  

  4. Collections
  

=========================
=: Your Implementation :=
=========================

- Provide an overview of each of the classes in your code, and what their
  function is in the overall game.
  
  There is gameCourt where I am adding iteams to the court and doing surtain functions that make the game run.
  The Game.java is my main and deals with the design of the canvas and stuff like that.
  Healthbar, makes and defines the proberities of a healthbar.
  Bullet is for the humanShip.
  FinelineIterator loops through the files.
  My Background.java switches the background.
  AlienShip is like humanShip.
  AlienShipDestruction is subclass of AlienShip and deals with the destruction of the alienship.


- Were there any significant stumbling blocks while you were implementing your
  game (related to your design, or otherwise)?
  Yeah. I/O. I was getting mutiple of inputs after a game and other buggy stuff.


- Evaluate your design. Is there a good separation of functionality? How well is
  private state encapsulated? What would you refactor, if given the chance?
  I don't Really Know. I would spend more time with the design. I could have added sound to the game.



========================
=: External Resources :=
========================

- Cite any external resources (libraries, images, tutorials, etc.) that you may
  have used while implementing your game.
  Pizza. StackOverFlow for the Arrays.sort(int a []);
